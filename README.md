# Advanced volume control

A GNOME Shell extension providing volume control for multiple devices.

This is no longer maintained as the improved handling of multiple devices in GNOME Shell 46 renders it obsolete.

As discussed on the [Linux Matters podcast](https://linuxmatters.sh/).

Get it from the [GNOME Extensions](https://extensions.gnome.org/extension/6036/advanced-volume-control/) site.

When active, this extension adds an indicator to your top panel. When clicked, a menu is displayed listing all audio outputs
detected by pulseaudio, and allows the volume to be set for each with a slider
